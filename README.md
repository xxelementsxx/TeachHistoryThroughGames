# TeachHistoryThroughGames
In my master's thesis, I investigated factors that influence the learning effect and the memory performance of humans. For this purpose, I developed a virtual learning environment in the form of a university building, in which exciting puzzles and tasks are to be solved. The goal is, starting as a young student, to travel through the different eras of university history and constantly increase knowledge, know-how and reputation.
